**PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**

The goal of this project is to create a model that can accurately predict when a credit card company will lose a customer. The other goal of this activity is to find the main reasons why clients leave and give you useful information to help you keep clients. The work will include gathering data, cleaning it up, analyzing it, choosing which features to use, and building a model using machine learning techniques.

High customer turnover rates hurt a business's bottom line, so keeping customers and lowering churn rates are important for making more money. Through this project, the company will be able to find customers who are likely to leave and create targeted, preventative campaigns to keep those customers.
